You will need nodejs to run the program and have Money Tracker locally on your computer. Get a local repository of the program first by running this command in the command line:
‘git clone https://github.com/ayastreb/money-tracker.git’
Change directory to the newly created money-tracker folder.
‘cd money-tracker’
After that, use
‘npm install’
to install node dependencies needed to run the program. If it doesn’t work out, then you may need to install nodejs before continuing on. After those steps are done, then lastly you can run the program using
‘npm start’
The program will be open in a browser once the command is run.

The first screen you will be brought up to will be the initial money tracker setup where you can initialize your first account that you wish to track. You will first want to determine what kind of money you’re trying to keep track of, whether it's just random expenses, your bank account, your wallet, or anything else that you’re thinking of. You can also set the type of currency that you’re using if it’s not in American dollars.Another thing you should do is set the amount of money that your wallet, bank account, or whatever you’re thinking of already has. Lastly, you will need to give it a title under the account name and then click on “Save account”. Repeat these steps for as many accounts that you wish to keep track of and then you can click finish.

The second screen will bring you to your dashboard where you can add expenses, transfer money, or add your income to any of your accounts. You can add tags and notes to each item to keep track of what it is that you’re adding. There is also a date icon if you wish to add specific dates to each item. The top dropdown bar allows you to swap between your accounts.

You can see the transactions page and it will list all of the total transactions that you have added and tell you your total income and total expenses that you have. The accounts page allows you to see each individual account and allows you to also add new accounts that you may have thought of. The reports page allows you to see your income in green and expenses in red per month for an account as a bar chart. The budget page is a work in progress so it is not available yet. If you wish to change the type of currencies that you’re working with, then you can navigate over to the settings on the left and change your base currency there.
